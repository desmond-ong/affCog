### Data

The data for the 4 experiments presented in the paper are in the [/data](https://github.com/desmond-ong/affCog/tree/master/data) folder



### Analysis code

Analysis code is provided in [affCog_analysis.Rmd](https://github.com/desmond-ong/affCog/blob/master/affCog_analysis.Rmd) (a R Markdown document). 

The file contains all the R code necessary to replicate the analyses reported in the paper.

Here's the [HTML-knitted version](http://rawgit.com/desmond-ong/affCog/master/affCog_analysis.html) of the .Rmd document.
Note that all the analyses are there in the file, but right now the formatting (text; making it look pretty and readable) is only half done. This should happen soon...




### Sample Experiments

A sample of our experiments is also included in the repository. It takes approximately 7 to 12 minutes to finish each experiment. If you do finish an experiment, you'll also see a mockup of the data that would've been collected, had it been running live. The complete experiments can be loaded using the following links:

- [Experiment 1](http://rawgit.com/desmond-ong/affCog/master/Experiment1/index.html)
- [Experiment 2](http://rawgit.com/desmond-ong/affCog/master/Experiment2/index.html)
- [Experiment 3](http://rawgit.com/desmond-ong/affCog/master/Experiment3/index.html)
- [Experiment 4](http://rawgit.com/desmond-ong/affCog/master/Experiment4/index.html)
