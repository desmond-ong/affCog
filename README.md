### Data

The data for the 4 experiments presented in the paper are in the /data folder



### Analysis code

Analysis code is provided in affCog_analysis.Rmd (a R Markdown document). 

The file contains all the R code necessary to replicate the analyses reported in the paper.

Here's the knitted version of the .Rmd document: http://rawgit.com/desmond-ong/affCog/master/affCog_analysis.html
Note that all the analyses are there in the file, but right now the formatting (text; making it look pretty and readable) is only half done. This should happen soon...




### Sample Experiments

A sample of our experiments is also included in the repository. It takes approximately 7 to 12 minutes to finish each experiment. If you do finish an experiment, you'll also see a mockup of the data that would've been collected, had it been running live. The complete experiments can be loaded using the following links:
