# Affective Cognition
-----

This repository contains materials for the following paper:

Ong, D. C., Zaki, J., & Goodman, N. D. (in prep). Affective Cognition: Exploring lay theories of emotion.

This repository is maintained by Desmond Ong. Questions should be directed to desmond.ong@stanford.edu

### Data

The data for the 4 experiments presented in the paper are in the /data folder

### Analysis code

Analysis code is provided in affCog_analysis.Rmd (a R Markdown document). 

I have not yet "cleaned" the markdown to make a readable document when compiled into a HTML document, but the file contains all the code necessary to replicate the analyses reported in the paper.

### Sample Experiments

A sample of our experiments are also included in the repository. It takes approximately 7 to 12 minutes to finish each experiment. If you do finish an experiment, you'll also see a mockup of the data that would've been collected, had it been running live. The complete experiments can be loaded using the following links:
