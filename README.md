# Affective Cognition
-----

This repository contains materials for the following paper:

Ong, D. C., Zaki, J., & Goodman, N. D. (in prep). Affective Cognition: Exploring lay theories of emotion.

This repository is maintained by Desmond Ong. Questions, comments, requests for clarification or replication, etc, should be directed to desmond (dot) ong (at) stanford (dot) edu



### Data

The data for the 4 experiments presented in the paper are in the /data folder



### Analysis code

Analysis code is provided in affCog_analysis.Rmd (a R Markdown document). 

The file contains all the R code necessary to replicate the analyses reported in the paper.

Though it is in R Markdown, I have not yet formatted the markdown to make a readable HTML document. This will happen soon.



### Sample Experiments

A sample of our experiments is also included in the repository. It takes approximately 7 to 12 minutes to finish each experiment. If you do finish an experiment, you'll also see a mockup of the data that would've been collected, had it been running live. The complete experiments can be loaded using the following links:
